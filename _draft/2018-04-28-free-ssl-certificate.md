<p>Need to secure your site, but not sure where to start? Are you looking for free SSL certificate for your domain? Here is a list of website where you can get a free SSL.</p>

* What type of SSL certificate should I purchase?
* Should I use a free certificate or purchase one from a vendor?
* Which certificate is best for securing a sub-domain? Multiple domains?
* How much warranty coverage do I need?
* How do I troubleshoot common installation problems?

Before we tackle those questions, let’s cover the basics. SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer, a security method which allows for the encryption of data when being transferred over a server. SSL certificates help to protect the transfer of sensitive information such as credit card numbers, passwords and usernames, Social Security numbers and more.

### What is SSL?

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. This secure link ensures that all data transferred between the web server and browsers remain private and integral.

### What does SSL stand for?
SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and, in short, it's the standard technology for keeping an internet connection secure and safeguarding any sensitive data that is being sent between two systems, preventing criminals from reading and modifying any information transferred, including potential personal details.

### Why use SSL?
The benefit of using an SSL certificate is that it offers encrypted protection during the online transfer of sensitive information. (Indeed, you are required by the Payment Card Industry (PCI) to have an SSL certificate if you collect credit card information on your site.) SSL certificates can also help you gain your customers’ trust and protect against phishing schemes.

### How does an SSL work?
The browser/server checks to see whether or not it trusts the SSL certificate. If so, it sends a message to the web server. The web server sends back a digitally signed acknowledgement to start an SSL encrypted session. Encrypted data is shared between the browser/server and the web server.

### What kind of SSL do I need?
There are three common types of certificates. Choosing the right one will be based on the level of security your website needs. 

1. A domain-validated SSL certificate
2. An organization-validated certificate
3. An EV certificate

### Is SSL for free Safe?
Free SSL certificates are normally Domain Validated. They will provide encryption and https security. They are usually limited in timeframe as they are in essence a free trial. Most providers will limit a free certificate to once for a domain.

### How can I get SSL for free?
Here is the list of trusted providers who offer free SSL certificate.
