Now-a-days, DO is publicly offering 10$ credit for new user. But here is my trick for 50 dollar promo, though it's very old news (<a href="https://github.com/blog/1900-the-best-developer-tools-now-free-for-students">Announced</a> late 2014) but the deal is some of us still searching for opportunity to get his/her website on own domain up and running for free!
